## Inspiration
We wanted to construct LLM workflows to solve actual problems for people such as analysts, teachers and reporters!

## What it does
We built a DAG Flow representing the AI Agent steps of a workflow for a business analyst, in this case analyzing municipal bonds:
1.  Retrieve list of municipalities in California
2. For each municipality, use Brave Search to retrieve municipal government link
3. Use Mistral to crawl through domain to find pdf link.
4. Fallback to MultiOn to download pdf if download link can't be found
5. Ingest content such as PDF by chunking and extracting tables from PDF
6. Construct new revenue/expense/debt reports and graphs by reranking and retrieving relevant chunks

## How we built it
We setup abstracted reusable nodes that can be configured to depend on each other for each of the above steps. 

We used Brave search to get initial links from which to do LLM [Mistral] guided web crawl. For complicated cases we fallback to MultiOn to retrieve the relevant data.

We built a Streamlit UI to demo our workflow.

## Challenges we ran into
We quickly learned the difficulty of web crawling, parsing and interacting with HTML responses that sites return.

Additionally, working with PDF's was an additional challenge.

We learned the relative expense of different tools, such as that MultiOn cost $0.50 per call, so we had to resort to this tool as a fallback.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to do an End-To-End workflow of our approach.

## What we learned
Demoing usage of tools such as Mistral, MultiOn, Streamlit.

## What's next for rtrvr.ai
Hopefully more addons to come such as a workflow and data exchange to monetize the output of these workflows.
